Add the following debug log inside loadTransactions in src/store/transactionStore.ts after loading transactions:

console.log('Referral transactions:', transactions.filter(t => t.type === 'referral' && t.status === 'completed'));

This will show if referral transactions are loaded and their amounts.

Also, here is a SQL query to check referral transactions for the user:

SELECT id, user_id, type, amount, status, created_at
FROM transactions
WHERE user_id = '777adcbd-28e2-478d-885e-544022afcf55'
  AND type = 'referral'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

Run this query in your database to verify the referral transaction status and amount.

If referral transactions are missing or not completed, the bonus won't appear in the balance.

If referral transactions are present and completed, but still not showing, the issue is likely in frontend state update or caching.
